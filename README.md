# smileshare

A cross-platform mobile app that lets you take a photo and have cognitive services analyse it to ensure it contains a face and that the person is smiling, If it does it uploads it to Imgur(Privately) and stores it in EasyTables so it can be viewed from SmileShare

This was my submission for Microsoft Student Accelerator Phase 2

## Technologies/Libraries Used:
- Xamarin
- Emotion API to detect faces and emotions (Through Cognitive Services)
- Microsoft Azure (EasyTables and hosting it)
